visual:
Token Magic FX : subtle animations on drawing objects

behind the screen:
wonderwalls : visual indicator on wall type
monk's active tile triggers : scripted events (traps, teleportation, movement, pausing)

gears:
vehicles and mechanisms : rotate tiles and walls
multilevel tokens : dependency for V&M (i think this is the case)

optional (i think):
wallheight
better roofs
less fog
