# Overview
This repo contains a Compendium that has custom maps and tiles for use in Foundry VTT.

Included:
- Maps
- Walls
- Tile and variants for use in Foundry

NOT included:
- Monsters
- Any text from the campaign book

# Notes
You will need to populate monsters, any mod triggers, etc.

Please review the walls.  The walling work was done by one GM for their specific game.  Many rooms use Foundry's landscape walls heavily.  You may want these, or you may want to remove them.  It is recommended to move a token with sight around so you can see how the maps were set up, and make any needed change.

# Tile and Map Assets
Art assets in this module are stored in four folders:
- maps
- number_tokens
- scene_note
- tiles

## Maps
These contain the raw map files.  There is an extended entrance area for Floor 1, if you wish to use it.  Alternate versions are available via Tor's Emporium on Patreon.

## Number Tokens
These are all the map callouts, giving room numbers, navigation notes, and a few particular callouts as presented in the campaign.

## Tiles
The bulk of the tile art in this module.  Please note some rooms have "stages", and multiple tiles are provided for such rooms.

## Scene Note
Various Miscellany

# Teleporter Notes
Various tiles in this module act as anchors fur use in any third party teleportation module of your choice.  Examples include the bridge tiles, stair tiles, and "beam me up" tiles.

These are currently provided as is on the Tor version of maps.  Dependencies for teleportation or scene changing modules may come in future releases.  The current development plan is to include the tile, and then split the module into a "light" version containing only art assets, and a "heavy" version that includes more functionality as granted by third party modules.
