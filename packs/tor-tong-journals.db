{"name":"Multistage Tiles","content":"<h1>General</h1>\n<h2>Wall Blocks</h2>\n<p>Many of the crawlways and secret tunnels in this module are blocked by 2x1 (10\" x 5\") black tiles.  They blend in with the background fairly well.  In many cases they are marked with pair of crossed bones on the map image.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you are using Tor's map version you probably want to keep these in place, as Tor's walling technique leaves some extra space behind walls, and secret areas may be revealed without the black tiles that are in place..  On the Grimmash maps, there is less need as the Foundry walls are flush with the image walls.</p>\n<h2>Stone Block Doors</h2>\n<p>For each room that has a stone block that raises or lowers. there is a tile in place.  You may want to review the status of these tiles as you prep your session to ensure the tiles are in the status you want.</p>\n<h2>Monster/Statue Tiles</h2>\n<p>There are many areas in the tomb where statues come to life and attack.  We have tried to make tile are that can also be used as monster tokens, so you can seamlessly intergrate these events into the game.</p>\n<h1>Floor 1</h1>\n<h2>Entrances</h2>\n<p>There are tiles at each entrance that allow manipulation of the doors and hidden entrances.</p>\n<h2>Area 4a</h2>\n<p>There is a floor tile here that can be toggled on and off to show the pit trap below.</p>\n<h2>Area 5c</h2>\n<p>There are multiple tiles in case the players want to pry open the grate to the river below.</p>\n<h2>Area 12</h2>\n<p>There is a chest tile that can be manipulated.</p>\n<h2>Area 16</h2>\n<p>There are hidden chest tokens for teleportation to and from the chest interior art to the right of the adamantine fan.</p>\n<h1>Floor 2</h1>\n<h2>Area 20</h2>\n<p>To the side of areas 20 are a series of tiles that can be placed to give the affect of the room slowly flooding.  You can just frag the tiles over one by one as the flooding gets deeper.  The coffin and sunlight bean have multiple tokens you can play with to get various effects for the room.</p>\n<h2>Area 21</h2>\n<p>The base map has no doorway.  Two doorways are provided, one on each side of the hallway.  One variant has zombie heads sticking out, the other does not.</p>\n<h2>Area 22</h2>\n<p>The chariot tile can be moved.  In case you have a party that does things like that.</p>\n<h2>Area 27</h2>\n<p>This has elevated ceiling level tokens for lamps.</p>\n<h1>Floor 3</h1>\n<p>This floor has many 2x1 \"blocks\" in place as noted at the start of this document.</p>\n<h2>Area 32</h2>\n<p>There are multiple layouts off to the side.  These can be used in place as is, or used with macros or other modules to provided an animated effect.</p>\n<h2>Area 35</h2>\n<p>The stone block can be moved or hidden.  You may want to adjust the doors as needed for the effect you want here.</p>\n<h2>Area 38</h2>\n<p>The most confusing room in the whole campaign!  Hallway 38b has art that ends abruptly.  This is because the tile to the south can be moved into or out of the room to provide the correct visual appearance of things, depending on how your party encounters the room.  Tor's map has the access tunnel in place.  Grimmash's map has the tile pulled off to the side.</p>\n<h2>Area 39</h2>\n<p>The statues above and in the pit are tiles.  They can also be used, in the case of the golem especially, to make a seamless token for use in the encounter.  The tiles of the statues can be rotated by any means of your choosing.</p>\n<h2>Area 40</h2>\n<p>The skull is a tile.</p>\n<h2>Area 43</h2>\n<p>The curtains are tiles.</p>\n<h1>Floor 4</h1>\n<h2>Area 45</h2>\n<p>The plinth bases are a single tile, and the gargoyles are each individual tiles.  You can use these tiles to make seamless actor tokens if you desire.</p>\n<h2>Area 47</h2>\n<p>We made the elemental cells bigger so that parties of more than 4 PCs can actually partake.</p>\n<h3>Fire Cell</h3>\n<p>There is a tile that gives the effect of glowing magma.</p>\n<h3>Water Cell</h3>\n<p>There are three tiles next to the fire tile floor that can be used to show increasing levels of flooding.</p>\n<h3>Air Cell</h3>\n<p>Above the air cell is a \"darkvision\" styled air cell that has somewhat discernable features.</p>\n<h3>Earth Cell</h3>\n<p>There are tiles for the grinder, and the floor below.  There are also version backed into the map if you need to move specific tokens to these locations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Area 48</h2>\n<p>Each statue is an individual token, and can be used to create actors as well.  Above the room are pottery shards, and in the module assets are more variations of broken terracotta.</p>\n<h2>Area 49</h2>\n<p>The stone blocks are tiles.  You may want to adjust the doors.</p>\n<h2>Area 50</h2>\n<p>We made this room bigger to allow for all the NPC that exist in the mirror to actually fit in the room.  There is a 3x3 two sided variant so you can also have an \"inside\" and \"outside\" the mirror option.</p>\n<h2>Area 52</h2>\n<p>Multiple floor variants are provided.  The statue in the corridor to area 53 is a tile that can be moved.</p>\n<h2>Area 54</h2>\n<p>The rolling stone, and the acid pit cover, are tiles that can be hidden and moved around.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Floor 5</h1>\n<h2>Areas 58, 50, 60</h2>\n<p>The cogs are tiles.  They are designed with intent to be animated via macros and/or modules, but also work just fine as they are.  Future updates may contain macros and/or mod dependencies to facilitate this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Are 58 also has a mist tile that is in place and hidden.</p>\n<h2>Area 61</h2>\n<p>The control panel has alternate tiles that allow it to be moved and to open to show the exit of the tunnel from area 70.  There is also a slime flood floor tiles that can be used if that scenario is triggered.</p>\n<h2>Area 62</h2>\n<p>The stone juggernaut is a tile that can be used to create a monster actor token.</p>\n<h2>Area 63</h2>\n<p>The top of the map has two variant tiles for room 63 depends on the states you want to use.</p>\n<h2>Area 67</h2>\n<p>The golden mastodon is a tile that can be rotated or animated with macros/other modules.</p>\n<h2>Slime Pools</h2>\n<p>The top left corner of the map has a variety of slime tiles that can be placed either per the module or per your own desires, or left our completely.</p>\n<h1>Floor 6</h1>\n<h2>Area 77</h2>\n<p>On the side of the map you can see struts, tentacles, the central portion of the main feature of the room.  Some of these are already placed on the map in the \"default\" configuration.  The large lava tile allows for a \"destroyed\" state if needed. </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hyn5lX7Y2eyGWGXT":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ILca0vBC31vw8YPI"}},"_id":"VOvXfsSU8UaR80LO"}
